We're building a system that combines ChatGPT with the Bhashini API to help people communicate more easily across different Indian languages. It works by translating a user's query into English, processing it through ChatGPT, and then translating the response back into the original language. With support for both text and voice, users can interact in the way that suits them best—whether typing or speaking.
One of the main goals is to make legal information more accessible. The system will be able to translate and simplify complex legal documents into a person’s preferred language, helping them better understand their rights and procedures. This is especially important for people who may not be fluent in English.
By combining the power of AI language models with Bhashini’s multilingual tools—like speech recognition, translation, and text-to-speech—we’re aiming to break down language barriers. The system will help people access important services and information in their own language, making things clearer, fairer, and more inclusive, whether it’s for legal help, government services, or customer support.
